v0.2

Added `d3ForceNetwork` for creating force directed network graphs where link distance and group changes the graphs attributes.

`d3SimpleNetwork` and `d3Network` are now the same and have improved aesthetic customisability. `d3Network` is depricated. This is in advance of creating functions for force directed and other types of networks.

`JSONtoDF` command added for reading a JSON data file into R. It converts a specified array in the JSON data  into a data frame.

Improvements to the internal workings of the commands. Now uses mustache templates to create the graphs.

Documentation and minor bug fixes.

v0.1.2

Internal improvements using whisker templating.
